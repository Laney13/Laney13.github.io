  <p>Kogami Shinya<span class="role">Troubled hero</span><br />
  <small>An enforcer under Akane's supervision. His quick-thinking often outsmarts the criminals and saves the team but there is one criminal mastermind he still hasn't caught up with. Can be reckless at times but his heart's in the right place. Likes reading old books.</small></p></div>

  <p>Nobuchika Ginoza<span class="role">Inspector</span><br />
  <small>This guy comes across very serious and can be blunt and critical at times but he has his reasons. He does things by the book and tries to avoid unnecessary risks. Protective and reliable, if not that much fun at a party...</small></p></div>
